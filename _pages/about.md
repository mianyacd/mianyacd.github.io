I am a third-year PhD candidate at Rutgers University, working under the guidance of [Professor Vijay Atluri](https://sites.rutgers.edu/vijay-atluri/). My research focuses on advancing knowledge in **Access Control**, **Privacy Analysis**, and **Graph Analysis**, with the goal of addressing critical challenges in data security and privacy.
