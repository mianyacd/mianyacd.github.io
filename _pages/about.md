I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Rutgers University, working under the guidance of [Professor Vijay Atluri](https://sites.rutgers.edu/vijay-atluri/). My research integrates **Access Control**, **Privacy Analysis**, and **Graph Analysis**, with the goal of developing AI-driven frameworks that leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interpret natural language policies and ensure regulatory compliance in data security environments.
